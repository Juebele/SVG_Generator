## Purpose
I made this project to help me generate simple logos for my projects
## Function
This takes user input in the CLI and uses it to generate a custom SVG file. Just use node index.js in the terminal to run the application and fill in the prompts. The CLI will not accept more than 3 letters and at least one letter is required. When finished, the SVG file will be available in the "examples" folder. Open this file in the browser to see the image.
